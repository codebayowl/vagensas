## Contains:
### CSS
Two separate files:
* styles.scss compiles partial files starting with _*.scss		
* svg.scss - styles for SVG files
Have no clue why I keep them separated but I feel it better then mix alltogether. Fix me if I'm not right (yeah, I know about decreasing the number of queries to server)
### PUG

The same principle that in SCSS - aggregator files with partial _*.pug files.
There could be several aggregators using the same partial blocks.

### JS
Nothing to say for now
